# GraphiQL Explorer

So cool. 

GraphiQL is an IDE. 

You can explore and dig around the data like a directory, and GraphiQL will build the query for you so it can be copy-pasted without us needing to manually and tediously type the queries, risking errors.

Commands:
ctrl + space => autocomplete!!! pre-fills query
ctrl + return => runs query

after query is run, you receive array of `File` nodes - objects in a graph, each containing queried fields

shape of data matches shape of query

# Source plugins
They fetch data from the source. Plugins can be specific to their sources.
